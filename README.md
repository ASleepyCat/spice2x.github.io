Before you file a new issue in the issue tracker:

* Please visit the website and read it through, especially the **known issues** section.
* In SpiceCfg, if you hover over (?) icon next to each option, a helpful mouseover text will appear that will most likely answer your questions.
* Use the search function and see if there is an exiting issue. 
* Make sure to post the log file (log.txt) as an attachment, and remove any personally identifiable information.
* This is not the place to ask about other projects, especially EA servers. Bad servers can (and will) crash your game.
