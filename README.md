# spice2x

## Overview

spice2x is a fork of SpiceTools, focused on addressing bugs, usability, and quality-of-life improvements.

We do not use GitHub for source control, but we do use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/spice2x/spice2x.github.io/issues) and [the wiki](https://github.com/spice2x/spice2x.github.io/wiki). Source is distributed in the release package.

spice2x team does not provide any tools to circumvent software copy protection, nor distribute any copyright-protected game data.

[List of supported games](https://github.com/spice2x/spice2x.github.io/wiki/List-of-supported-games)

## How do I set up game data & start playing?

By policy,

* we do **NOT** provide links on where to acquire game data
* we do **NOT** provide guides on setting up & basic troubleshooting

please do not ask for these, as it will never happen here.

## Submitting to the Issue Tracker
Rules for filing a new issue or adding comments to existing issues in the tracker:

* Check the [known issues](https://github.com/spice2x/spice2x.github.io/wiki/Known-issues) page first before reporting a new issue.
* Use the search function and see if there is an existing issue. 
* This is not the place to obtain a guide or receive basic troubleshooting.
* Don't file a bug demanding game XYZ to be supported.
* **Do not link to external websites that distribute game data!**
* **Do not link to external websites that provide guides on how to run games!**

New GitHub accounts are prevented from creating new issues to prevent spam. Maintainers of this project reserve the right to close or delete any issues that violate the rules above, or low effort issues.

## Contributing
