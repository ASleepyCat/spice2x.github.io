spice2x is a fork of SpiceTools, focused on addressing bugs, usability, and quality-of-life improvements

Please visit the homepage: **[https://spice2x.github.io/](https://spice2x.github.io/)**

We do not use GitHub for source control, but we do use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/spice2x/spice2x.github.io/issues) and [the wiki](https://github.com/spice2x/spice2x.github.io/wiki).

Before you file a new issue in the issue tracker:

* Check the [known issues](https://github.com/spice2x/spice2x.github.io/wiki/Known-issues) page first.
* Make sure you are on the latest version.
* In SpiceCfg, if you hover over (?) icon next to each option, a helpful mouseover text will appear that will most likely answer your questions.
* Use the search function and see if there is an existing issue. 
* Make sure to post the log file (log.txt) as an attachment, and remove any personally identifiable information.
* This is not the place to ask about other projects, especially EA servers. Bad servers can (and will) crash your game.

New GitHub accounts are prevented from creating new issues to prevent spam.

Maintainers of this project reserve the right to close or delete any low effort issues.
