## Overview

We do not use GitHub for source control, but we do use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/spice2x/spice2x.github.io/issues) and [the wiki](https://github.com/spice2x/spice2x.github.io/wiki). Source is distributed in the release package.

[Features](https://github.com/spice2x/spice2x.github.io/wiki/spice2x-features)

## Submitting to the Issue Tracker
Rules for filing a new issue or adding comments to existing issues in the tracker:

* Check the [known issues](https://github.com/spice2x/spice2x.github.io/wiki/Known-issues) page first before reporting a new issue.
* Use the search function and see if there is an existing issue. 
* This is not the place to ask about other projects, especially EA servers. Bad servers can (and will) crash your game.
* **Do not link to external websites that distribute game data!**

New GitHub accounts are prevented from creating new issues to prevent spam.

Maintainers of this project reserve the right to close or delete any low effort issues.

## Contributing
**We encourage the community to submit patches via the issue tracker for any bug fixes or feature enhancements.** If you want to resolve any reported (or not reported) bugs, implement features, add support for new games, or fix a [known issue](https://github.com/spice2x/spice2x.github.io/wiki/Known-issues) - feel free to reach out via the Issue tracker.

Baseline rules for adding support for games:

* No BomberGirl, as long as the Free To Play service is still alive.
* No support for that one touch screen game that dispenses plushes of mouse character (`O26`).
* No support for eaCloud ("Konasute") games.
* For a new game that was never supported (not a new version of a game, but rather a new series): please wait 1 year after official AC release in Japan.
* For new version of an already supported game: proceed with caution and use generally-accepted community guidelines.
