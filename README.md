# spice2x

## Overview

spice2x is a fork of SpiceTools, focused on addressing bugs, usability, and quality-of-life improvements.

We do not use GitHub for source control, but we do use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/spice2x/spice2x.github.io/issues) and [the wiki](https://github.com/spice2x/spice2x.github.io/wiki). Source is distributed in the release package.

spice2x team does not provide any tools to circumvent software copy protection, nor distribute any copyright-protected game data.

## Submitting to the Issue Tracker
Rules for filing a new issue or adding comments to existing issues in the tracker:

* Check the [known issues](https://github.com/spice2x/spice2x.github.io/wiki/Known-issues) page first before reporting a new issue.
* Use the search function and see if there is an existing issue. 
* This is not the place to ask about other projects, especially EA servers. Bad servers can (and will) crash your game.
* **Do not link to external websites that distribute game data!**

New GitHub accounts are prevented from creating new issues to prevent spam.

Maintainers of this project reserve the right to close or delete any low effort issues.

## Contributing
**We encourage the community to submit patches via the issue tracker for any bug fixes or feature enhancements.** If you want to resolve any reported (or not reported) bugs, implement features, add support for new games, or fix a [known issue](https://github.com/spice2x/spice2x.github.io/wiki/Known-issues) - feel free to reach out via the Issue tracker. All submitted code patches are assumed to be GPLv3 compliant.

Please see [CONTRIBUTING page](https://github.com/spice2x/spice2x.github.io/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for a full list of guidelines when submitting code.
